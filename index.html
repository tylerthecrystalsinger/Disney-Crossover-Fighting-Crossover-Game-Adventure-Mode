<p>It was a beautiful day at Disneyland Anaheim California and alot of characters were Meeting and Greeting Guests. Just then Thanos came in the entrance to Disneyland and decided to cause destruction by snapping his gauntlet. The Disney characters tried to fight him, but unfortunately the majority of them got disintegrated. The only fighters remaining were Mickey Mouse, Sheriff Woody, Captain America, Rey, Sora, and Kermit the Frog.</p>
